Welcome to SONYC: Sounds of New York City
=========================================

The CUSP SONYC project aims to mapping the soundscape of NYC. 
We need your help to tag sounds from our urban sound database. In the future you'll be able to contribute your own
sound recordings too!

We are training our artificial ears to identify sounds within the urban soundscapes of NYC, 
so the more we train the better our ear will hear!

Help us by telling us what you hear within the soundscape and where you hear it.
